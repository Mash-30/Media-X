# Micro-Frontend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the micro-frontend architecture implemented for the Social Media App. The architecture is designed to enable independent development, deployment, and scaling of different features as separate modules.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Module Independence
- Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- Modules have their own package.json, dependencies, and build configuration
- Clear boundaries between modules with well-defined interfaces

### 2. Shared Dependencies
- Common libraries (React, React Native, Expo) are shared across modules
- Shared utilities, hooks, and services are centralized
- Consistent styling and theming across all modules

### 3. Module Federation
- Webpack Module Federation enables dynamic loading of remote modules
- Each module exposes specific components and functionality
- Shell application orchestrates the loading and integration of modules

## Module Structure

### Shared Layer (`/shared`)
Contains common functionality used across all modules:

```
shared/
├── components/          # Shared UI components
├── hooks/              # Shared custom hooks
├── utils/              # Shared utilities and constants
├── services/           # Shared API and business logic
└── styles/             # Shared styling and theming
```

### Module Layer (`/modules`)
Each module represents a specific feature domain:

```
modules/
├── auth/               # Authentication module
├── feed/               # Posts and feed module
├── profile/            # User profile module
├── explore/            # Discovery and search module
├── messaging/          # Chat and messaging module
└── notifications/      # Notifications module
```

### Shell Layer (`/shell`)
Main application shell that orchestrates modules:

```
shell/
├── components/         # Shell-specific components
├── navigation/         # Main navigation logic
├── providers/          # Context providers
└── pages/             # Shell pages
```

## Module Federation Configuration

### Shell Configuration
The shell acts as the main application and loads remote modules:

```javascript
// config/module-federation.config.js
{
  name: 'shell',
  remotes: {
    auth: 'auth@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
    feed: 'feed@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
    // ... other modules
  }
}
```

### Module Configuration
Each module exposes specific components and functionality:

```javascript
// Example: Auth module
{
  name: 'auth',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './LoginForm': './modules/auth/components/LoginForm',
    './RegisterForm': './modules/auth/components/RegisterForm',
    './useAuth': './shared/hooks/useAuth',
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Module Development
- Each module can be developed independently
- Modules have their own development server
- Hot reloading works within each module

### 2. Integration Testing
- Modules are integrated in the shell application
- End-to-end testing across module boundaries
- Cross-module communication testing

### 3. Deployment
- Each module can be deployed independently
- Shell application loads modules from their deployed URLs
- Version management for module compatibility

## Communication Between Modules

### 1. Shared State
- Authentication state managed in shell
- User context shared across all modules
- Global app state through React Context

### 2. Event Communication
- Custom events for cross-module communication
- Pub/Sub pattern for loose coupling
- Navigation events for module coordination

### 3. API Communication
- Shared API client for consistent data fetching
- Module-specific API services
- Centralized error handling

## Benefits

### 1. Scalability
- Teams can work on different modules simultaneously
- Independent scaling of modules based on usage
- Reduced build times for individual modules

### 2. Maintainability
- Smaller, focused codebases
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to understand and modify individual features

### 3. Technology Flexibility
- Modules can use different technologies if needed
- Gradual migration of legacy code
- Experimentation with new technologies

### 4. Deployment Flexibility
- Independent deployment cycles
- A/B testing of individual modules
- Rollback capabilities per module

## Best Practices

### 1. Module Design
- Keep modules focused on specific domains
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Use clear interfaces for module communication

### 2. Shared Code
- Extract common functionality to shared layer
- Maintain consistent patterns across modules
- Regular review of shared dependencies

### 3. Testing
- Unit tests within each module
- Integration tests for module interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### 4. Performance
- Lazy loading of modules
- Code splitting within modules
- Optimized bundle sizes

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up shared layer and utilities
- Create module federation configuration
- Establish development environment

### Phase 2: Module Extraction
- Extract existing features into modules
- Create module-specific components and logic
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 3: Module Federation
- Implement dynamic module loading
- Set up remote module development
- Configure deployment pipelines

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Performance optimization
- Advanced features and integrations
- Monitoring and analytics

## Tools and Technologies

### Build Tools
- Webpack with Module Federation
- Metro bundler for React Native
- TypeScript for type safety

### Development Tools
